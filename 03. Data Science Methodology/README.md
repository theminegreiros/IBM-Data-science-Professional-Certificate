## Data Science Methodology
## Week 1
### From Problem to Approach
### Main Topics
* The need to understand and prioritize the business goal.
* The way stakeholder support influences a project.
* The importance of selecting the right model.
* When to use a predictive, descriptive, or classification model.    
### From Requirement to Collection
### Main Topics
* The significance of defining the data requirements for your model.
* Why the content, format, and representation of your data matter.   
* The importance of identifying the correct sources of data for your project.
* How to handle unavailable and redundant data.
* To anticipate the needs of future stages in the process.
## Week 2 
### From Understanding to Preparation
### Main Topics
* The importance of descriptive statistics. 
* How to manage missing, invalid, or misleading data.
* The need to clean data and sometimes transform it.
* The consequences of bad data for the model.
* Data understanding is iterative; you learn more about your data the more you study it. 
### From Modeling to Evaluation
* The difference between descriptive and predictive models.
* The role of training sets and test sets.
* The importance of asking if the question has been answered.
* Why diagnostic measures tools are needed.
* The purpose of statistical significance tests.
* That modeling and evaluation are iterative processes.
### From Deployment to Feedback
### Main Topics
* The importance of stakeholder input.
* To consider the scale of deployment.
* The importance of incorporating feedback to refine the model.
* The refined model must be redeployed.
* This process should be repeated as often as necessary.
