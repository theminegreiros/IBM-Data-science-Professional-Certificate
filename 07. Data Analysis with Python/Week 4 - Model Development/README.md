## Model Development
This Lab we practiced and created several models that will predict the price of the car using the variables or features. 
## Main Topics
### Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression
* Slope (.coef_)
* Intercept (.intercept_)
### Model Evaluation Using Visualization
* Regression Plot (sns.regplot)
* Residual Plot (sns.residplot)
### Polynomial Regression and Pipelines
* PolynomialFeatures
* Pipeline 
* StandardScaler
### Measures for In-Sample Evaluation
* R^2 / R-squared
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
### Prediction and Decision Making
* .predict
